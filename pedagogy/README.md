<b> Experiment|     <b> 1. To create a simple html file to demonstrate the use of different tags.



<a name="LO"></a>
#### 1. Focus Area :
In this problem approach we will show how different HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language )  tags makes use of various tags to format the content & understand  the structure of HTML document .

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-
1.| Understanding the concept of HTML various tags and understand how they behave, while formatting a textual document.| Understand | Classify
2.| Understanding the application of HTML Tags  | Understand | Demonstrate
3.| Understanding how Tags  are how they behave, while formatting a textual document .| Understand | Interpret
4.| When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties , according to the understandings so far.| Analyse | Inspect

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>  Problem based expository
Assessment Method: Practical based
Description:  This experiment enables the students to understand the concept of HTML various tags. It offers students a chance to gain deeper learning for tags  of HTML . An HTML tag is commonly defined as a set of characters constituting a formatted command for a Web page. At the core of HTML, tags provide the directions or recipes for the visual content that one sees on the Web.
 Simulator:  HTML tags have always been important in the history of Web design. During the early days of the World Wide Web, they were responsible for a majority of Web code. That may not be the case anymore, but HTML tags are still at the center of how Web pages are formatted. Other kinds of languages have been built around the backbone of HTML.
 
Here in understanding of working of HTML tags we are proposing simulation having three interfaces ;In the first interface we will  provide user to  input  tags from our  collection of tags section  .When we click particular HTML Tag ,code regarding it will reflect in next section of interface  & in last  interface we will have result as it will be show in our web browser .

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--
1.| Student clicks on the simulation tab.	Simulator screen of the experiment will open up.	| Simulator screen of the experiment will open up' |	To open screen for performing the experiment.
2.| Student will select the HTML tag from the drop down box he wants to perform | The input given to drop down  box from the chosen options which will appear on the simulator’s screen.	Open the desired HTML Tag . '  | Open the desired HTML Tag .
3.| Student will edit code with respect to code  as per the conversion selected  |	Input value appears in the simulator’s  result box '|	Providing input to simulator  for understanding.
4.| 	Click on  the Result button. |Simulator performs the  operation to display the HTML Tags ' | Generate result for the selected tags
