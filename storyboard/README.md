## Storyboard (Round 2)

Delete this line before submission : The core principle of Round 2 is to make the lab/experiment documentation elaborated in a manner that it makes easy for any person (developer/domain and non domain faculty/student) to understand and develop the lab/experiment.

Experiment 1: To create a simple html file to demonstrate the use of different tags.

### 1. Story Outline:

When my grandfather was studying in Allahabad University as  Physics student  ; he used to assist his Professor  in writing research paper`s .When my grandfather guide on deputation service for New York University , there mode of communication was post mail when set structure of content .But this procession of Information takes time sometime month for some suggestive guidelines .Understanding this problem  Tim Berners-Lee  invented the Web. In 1989, Tim was working in a computing services section of CERN when he came up with the concept; at the time he had no idea that it would be implemented on such an enormous scale. Particle physics research often involves collaboration among institutes from all over the world. Tim had the idea of enabling researchers from remote sites in the world to organize and pool together information. But far from simply making available a large number of research documents as files that could be downloaded to individual computers, he suggested that you could actually link the text in the files themselves.
In other words, there could be cross-references from one research paper to another. This would mean that while reading one research paper, you could quickly display part of another paper that holds directly relevant text or diagrams. Documentation of a scientific and mathematical nature would thus be represented as a `web' of information held in electronic form on computers across the world. This, Tim thought, could be done by using some form of hypertext, some way of linking documents together by using buttons on the screen, which you simply clicked on to jump from one paper to another. Before coming to CERN, Tim had already worked on document production and text processing, and had developed his first hypertext system, `Enquire', in 1980 for his own personal use.Tim's prototype Web browser on the NeXT computer came out in 1990.

Tim demonstrated a basic, but attractive way of publishing text by developing some software himself, and also his own simple protocol - HTTP - for retrieving other documents' text via hypertext links. Tim's own protocol, HTTP, stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. The text format for HTTP was named HTML, for HyperText Mark-up Language; Tim's hypertext implementation was demonstrated on a NeXT workstation, which provided many of the tools he needed to develop his first prototype. By keeping things very simple, Tim encouraged others to build upon his ideas and to design further software for displaying HTML, and for setting up their own HTML documents ready for access.HTML works on Tags which is focus of our experiment .

### 2. Story
To understand the content structuring of HTML we have different basic tags which help us to construct the HTML web page with .html extension . An HTML  document is composed of three parts: a line containing HTML version information,  a declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element), a body, which contains the document's actual content. The body may be implemented by the BODY element or the FRAMESET element. For structuring content in the body element we use many basic elements as Tags . The basic elements of an HTML page are  : A text header, denoted using the ,,h1,,, ,,h2,,, ,,h3,,, ,,h4,,, ,,h5,,, ,,h6,, tags. A paragraph, denoted using the ,,p,, tag. A horizontal ruler, denoted using the ,,hr,, tag and many more are defined as per requirement of content management .
For the understanding we propose a simulator in first part we proposed definition where the different element defined as Tags are defined .After developing the understanding we will demonstrate the coding structure for uses as in development of web page .
In the next interface the user can interpret it by applying their inputs then analyze and inspect the selected HTML tag .

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
In our simulator we will  have four interfaces of communications .In first we will select the Tag of element .When we select tag from drop down box there definition of tag will reflect there , after selection Tag application code will be reflected in next interface .
User  can copy code from there in interpretation box and do changes which will reflect as final change in last interface .
In our simulator we will have four interface which work in coordination to make user understanding of HTML Tags

In our simulator we will have four interface which work in coordination to make user understanding of HTML Tags 

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
User objective should be understand the webpage development through HTML .User will able to understand the element and  Tags going through our simulator .

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:
When user will come to our simulator for performing experiment ,he will see 4 interfaces ;
1) On the simulator screen,  User will be able to understand basic HTML Tags .
2) First of all User  will be able to give input in  first interface from drop down box of basic HTML tags , user will select & its definition will be updated in the interface .
3) In the second interface in our simulator we will have demonstrative code of selected HTML tags .
4) In the third interface user will able to copy code or write code and interpret code as per  desired input from user  side .
5) In the fourth interface the final result will be updated as per given input .



##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

For understanding of basic Tags of HTML we will make sure user understand the HTML Tags .

1) HTML stands for -
a)	HighText Machine Language
b)	HyperText and links Markup Language
c)	HyperText Markup Language
d)	None of these
Ans :  ( c )
2) The correct sequence of HTML tags for starting a webpage is -
a)	Head, Title, HTML, body
b)	HTML, Body, Title, Head
c)	HTML, Head, Title, Body
d)	HTML, Head, Title, Body

Ans :  ( d )
3) Which of the following element is responsible for making the text bold in HTML?
a)	<,,pre>
b)	<,a,>
c)	<,b,>
d)	<,br,>

Ans ( c )

4) Which of the following tag is used for inserting the largest heading in HTML?
a)	<,h3,>
b)	<,h1,>
c)	<,h5,>
d)	<,h6,>

Ans ( b)
5) Which of the following tag is used to insert a line-break in HTML?
a)	<,br,>
b)	<,a,>
c)	<,pre,>
d)	<,b,>

Ans (  a )


 


##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
In our simulator user can use  as many tag he  want as per your code requirement.
All HTML tags must enclosed within <`  `  > these brackets. Every tag in HTML perform different tasks. Syntax <,,tag,,> content <,,/tag,,> if the Syntax will not be followed it will show error or tag will not run . If you have used an open tag <,,tag,,>, then you must use a close tag <,,/tag,,> (except some tags) . 



##### 2.6 Conclusion:
User will be able to use our simulator and will be able to understand HTML Tag for Web Development .

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
Type equations here : (guide : ( a separate sheet having equations / programs for the lab exper3ment to be shared along with the Story submissions (1) . You can mark it as numerical reference numbers within the story narration (like we cite in the research papers) and then separately share these equations/programs sheets as a reference, do not include the equations as a whole in the narration))
Tool can be used to integrate formula in Markdown <b> [here](http://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/samples/example3.php) </b>

link to flow chart Here : Store in the  /flowchart folder within Round2 folder in your repo
<br>
(guide :The lab proposer should extract logic from the story, prepare a flowchart from the story narration and write the algorithm to execute the black box.  use Google Drawings https://docs.google.com/drawings/ (send the link to your flowchart and also attach .png by exporting it )

### 4. Mindmap:
<img src="mindmap/mindmap.png"/>
 Link to mindmap here : Store the mindmap in both .mm & .png extension in the  /mindmap folder and include link of only .pdf verison here
 <br>
 (guide : An elaborate mind map (connecting all the points in the experiment flow ) should be prepared and submitted by the lab proposer. The mind map should be a clear and detailed document that takes into account all minute intri5acies involved in the development of virtual lab. The mindmap should be self-content and any developer across the globe should be able to code it with all those details. using only FreeMind http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page (send the .png file and also the original .mm extension project file. )

### 5. Storyboard :
